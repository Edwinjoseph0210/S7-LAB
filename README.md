**First Experiment**  
*SIMPLE LEXER IN C*

This program reads a C source file (`sample.txt`) and tokenizes it into keywords, identifiers, operators, and punctuators. It also skips single-line comments (`//`).

# How to Use

1. Put your C code in `sample.txt`.  
2. Compile the program:

```bash
gcc lexer.c -o lexer

    Run it:

./lexer

The program prints tokens and their types to the console.
